# The Adventures of Wado and Wedo
A game about love, companionship, and of course the struggles that accompany them. Wado and Wedo go on an epic adventure that will test the very definition of friendship. Control both by yourself, or team up with a friend, as you learn to overcome the struggles and truly understand what it's like to have nothing to do.
